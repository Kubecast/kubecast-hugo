"FullName": "David Aronchick"
"Bio": "David likes to think of himself as having worked in technology since he first sat down in front of a Commodore 64 at the ripe old age of 6, but he definitely has been getting paid for it for the past 14 years. In that time he has founded three companies, filled a plaque with ship-it badges from Microsoft, and generally been astounded at the myriad ways the Internet gives us to waste time. He worked at Microsoft on a variety of teams until 2007, when he founding Hark. After that project, he spent time at both Amazon and Chef Software, before landing his current position at Google. His passions are new markets and digital media, and heaven help you if you get him starting to talk about them. David holds a BA from Dartmouth College."
