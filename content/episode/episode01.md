+++

In our first episode of Kubecast we interview the legendary Kelsey Hightower. In this interview Kelsey talks about the concept of NoOps, what kubernetes in production should look like, and why the kubernetes API is such a key piece in the automation process. We talked with Kelsey about the kubernetes book that he's writing and all the different workshops, conferences and different events he's doing or planning to do to evangelise about kubernetes. The interview was recorded during the ContainerSched conference, so the audio is not great. We would like to apologise in advance.
