In our second episode of Kubecast we interview Gabe Monroy. In this interview Gabe talks about where the idea behind  "The Children's Illustrated Guide to Kubernetes" came from and how, not only a children's book was created, but another important project that it would become the de facto package manager for Kubernetes: Helm.

We talked a bit about the concept of NoOps and how Deis workflow help companies to reach that "Heroku way" of deploying and managing applications. Usual suspects like poor documentation and many moving parts in the installation of a kubernetes cluster and how it makes for some companies lose the focus of what is important for them.

Finally, we talked about another topic is becoming a buzzword almost: Cloud Native Applications. We ended up talking how Deis does internal development using Kubernetes.

Last but not least, Gabe gives great advise to companies who are looking at getting into Kubernetes.
