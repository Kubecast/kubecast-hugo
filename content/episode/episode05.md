In this episode with interview David O'Dwyer, from Livewyer, the first English company who joined the CNCF.

During this interview, we talked about the origins of the Kubernetes London Meetup. We talked about KubeCon,
and the CNCF conference that happened in Seattle recently.

David has built an Alexa-kubernetes integration and we tested it live. Last but not least, we talked about
the super awesome Kubernetes Community!

The longest episode so far, but one of the best ones!
